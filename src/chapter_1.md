# Introduction

Hardik, reader. Reader, Hardik. I am 24, and I like writing‚Äîat least, I used
to. There was a moment in my life when I zoomed out on my interests. People
called it maturing, and then I realised that my calling is building. Building
what? Building buildings? The answer was simpler in my case: I just like
building. There's a lot of fun for me, in the process. This newsletter, for me,
is a way to pick up the metaphorical pen‚Äîalthough
I can type faster than I write. My partner would vouch for that.

These writings will also be published on my website [here](https://hardikphalet.github.io).
I‚Äôm hoping that
I‚Äôll use it enough to look back and remember the old days, the way people do
with their diaries or journals.
I‚Äôll document here the things I liked, the things I did,
and my thoughts on them‚Äîif any.

So, here goes nothing:

The title of articles I have embedded here are in-line with my thoughts on the
matter. I am a software engineer by profession, and contrary to popular thought
on the matter AI is not coming for my job. It cannot. It's a glorified
auto-correct. Many tools today, e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini have an option
of making the AI `think` before responding. That raises a few eye-brows.
Is AI thinking? Of course not! It's not made to do that. It can statistically
predict what word comes \<predicting...\> next. That's all there is to it.
For the longest time, it couldn't tell how many r's are in the word strawberry.
[How many r's in Strawberry? Why is this a very difficult question for the AI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1enqk04/how_many_rs_in_strawberry_why_is_this_a_very/).

The more worrying part is, how quickly we gobble the shit it says to us.
At work, we handle a lot of engineering problems that no person has ever faced
before. No one has ever publicaly written about these things for the AI to
train on, and what happens then? AI crumbles. No better than a summer school
intern. Most people don't get to see that part of AI. AI is an expert at producing slop,
which most people find satisfactory. That's the real problem. AI is never at
fault and we have no standards for it.

To further clarify my thoughts on this, here's an anecdote.

```
Once upon a midnight yucky,
While I stumbled, tired and mucky,
Over many a squeaky floorboard of my auntie's moldy shack‚Äî
Suddenly there came a crashing,
Like some rotten cabbage mashing,
And I tripped upon a trashing rat who bit me on the back.
‚ÄúGross!‚Äù I muttered,
And my sandwich buttered,
‚ÄúWho attacks a man like that?‚Äù

Then the wind began a-wailing,
And my stomach started flailing,
For the rat had stolen lunch and scampered off into the black.
‚ÄúOh dark and spooky pestilence!
Return my food, with condiments!‚Äù
But only silence answered‚Äî
And also a cat.
```

```
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow‚Äî
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
```

Ironically, corporate would see this and fire their talent for AI.

## Misc

### GRR Martin's latest work üö®
It's not a book. Not a movie. Not a show. It's a game. The usual reaction I
get from readers when I mention it is--yeugh, cringe, yucky. But hear me out,
or at least hear them out:
    - [Elden Ring](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u9QjjBFOXpY)
    - [ELDEN RING Lore for DUMMIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zicmFG_p1H8)
    - [The lore of Elden Ring is mesmerising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3b32G9o8s)
Apparently, GRRM wrote 5000 years worth of story for the game. Where to read it?
Nowhere! The game tells you nothing about it. So how does one go about reading it?
You play the most challenging game in the world, and figure out the story.
There's no guide, not one character doing expositions. As the game's opening
says, "Fallen leaves tell a story...". And boy do they do that. Roads, people's
attire (or lack of it), shrines, monuments, environments, cities, dragons, gods,
everything comes together to weave this beautiful world. A lot of it is upto
you the player, and there's no single bad character. It is the most remarkable
work of its creators. GRRM and Miyazaki cooked.


### See my world!
I am color blind, red-green color blind. I have even learnt the fancy name
for it: deuteranopia.
Anyway I found a tool for people to upload or paste their pictures in and
the webpage is supposed to show you how it would look to me.

## Books
### "The City & The City" by China Mi√©ville
Description from the internet: Two overlapping cities exist in the same physical space but are culturally and legally separate - residents must actively "unsee" the other city. When a murder crosses between them, a detective navigates this bizarre reality. Mind-bending urban fantasy that questions perception and borders.


Review: 6/10. I have read better books but a good detective mystery hits
different.

### "The Peregrine" by J.A. Baker
Description from the internet: A poetic obsession with following peregrine falcons through the English countryside for an entire season. Baker writes with hallucinogenic intensity about becoming one with the landscape and predator mindset. Reads like nature mysticism disguised as birdwatching.


Review: 2/10. I am not a fan of non-fiction. Seeing my partner read a lot of them
has compelled me to do so. For non-fiction fans, I would definitely recommend it.

### "The Goblin Emperor" by Katherine Addison
Description from the internet: A half-goblin prince unexpectedly inherits the throne of an elvish empire and must navigate deadly court politics with only kindness as his weapon. Court intrigue fantasy that chooses compassion over grimdark cynicism, with incredibly satisfying character development.


Review: 7/10. Micro-reading, if that's a thing is something I enjoy a lot.
Especially, when I am in between places. Would recommend. Loved the court drama.

### "Odyssey" by Homer
Description from the internet: The Odyssey is one of two major epics of ancient Greek literature attributed to Homer. It is one of the oldest surviving works of literature and remains popular with modern audiences. Like the Iliad, the Odyssey is divided into 24 books.

Review: Heaviest read this month, still ongoing. Just preparing for Nolan's
release. Not a big fan of Nolan, but wanted to catch up on the material.


## Movies
### Superman
[Superman (2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film))

Review: Heavy (and right) take on immigration. Decent acting. A lot of fun.

### Nosferatu
[Nosferatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu_(2024_film))

Review: A retelling of the iconic. Falls flat. I don't remember much of the
movie, and I said that while I was watching it. The actors did a really good
job. Apple really didn't fall far away from the tree in case of Skarsg√•rd.

### The Darjeeling Limited
[The Darjeeling Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darjeeling_Limited)

Review: Wes Anderson, a beautiful man. Beautiful characters. Beautiful.
